# The Flux Party — Queensland Constitution

## Introduction

This is the constitution for the Queensland political party named "The Flux Party Queensland", sometimes referred to as "Flux QLD" or "The Party" in this document.

The registered abbreviation for the party at the time of registration is “Flux QLD”.
Flux QLD is a state party associated with the federal party "VOTEFLUX.ORG | Upgrade Democracy!" with the abbreviation "Flux".

The term "Flux AUS" is used to refer to the federal Flux Party, not the state party.

The Flux Party Queensland (Flux QLD) is hereby established as an organisation.

The canonical version of the constitution is stored in the repository at https://github.com/voteflux/flux/ under the file name ’CONSTITUTION.QLD.md’


Clauses should be referred to by line number and most recent commit hash.

Flux QLD intends to defer many of the responsibilities for running the party to the federal Flux party, and this is indicated in this document.

**This document is ratified when the federal Flux constitution is updated to reflect this fact.**
This will be recorded under the section titled "State and Territory Branches".
At the time of writing this link will take an observer to said ratification: https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md#state-and-territory-branches

## Objective

The primary objective of Flux <QLD is to promote the election of endorsed candidates to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. 

Promotion and endorsement of candidates will be contextually appropriate.

Further objectives:

* To provide every Queensland voter with real democratic potential.
* To use elected candidates as a gateway for electors to directly influence the Legislative Assembly, (and Legislative Council within Australian law), using an internal voting system.
* To provide the framework and means for minor parties and independents to participate productively without winning a seat.
* To facilitate a culture of engagement through empowering specialists and passionate voters;
* To stimulate the creation of new policy options

Flux QLD also adopts objectives of the federal Flux party where possible.

## Membership Criteria
